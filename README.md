# Benzinga Python Client

This is the the official documentation for Benzinga's Python Package. This package
Is compatible with Python v3.x+. For extensive instructions, visit [Benzinga Docs](https://docs.benzinga.io/benzinga-python/)

## Getting Started

The installation process varies depending on your python version and system used. 
The basic installation instructions are as follows:

```shell
pip install benzinga
```

Alternatively, the package can be installed by using:

```shell
pip3 install benzinga
```

Once you have successfully installed the package, you can either import the 
Financial Data module, for quantitative financial data:
```python
from benzinga import financial_data
```
or you can import the Benzinga News Data module, if you're looking into financial news:
```python
from benzinga import news_data
```

## Your Key

**Api Key** To initiate a class, an API key is used, for
authentication purposes. [Contact us](https://cloud.benzinga.com/lets-talk/) if you don't yet have a key, we will take care of you!

*Sample API Key (type: str) : "testkey892834789s9s8abshtuy"*

## Logging Information

**Log=True** by default. Purpose of logging is to determine when the call was made *(2020-10-21 08:02.29)* and get the 
status of API call within the console *(Status Code: 200)*

*Log (type: bool)*

## Sample Test Financial Data Module 

1. Initiating the class:

```python
from benzinga import financial_data
api_key = "testkey892834789s9s8abshtuy"
fin = financial_data.Benzinga(api_key)

# logging is by default True in above case, in order to turn off the logging set log to False 

fin = financial_data.Benzinga(api_key, log=False)
```

2. A sample test run to get ratings on a stock. (Returns a JSON object):

```python
stock_ratings = fin.ratings()
```

3. Since `fin.ratings()` returns a JSON dict, for a better view of the dict,
you can call the `fin.output()` method on the result. Example:

```python
fin.output(stock_ratings)
```

## Sample Test News Data Module

1. Initiating the class:

```python
from benzinga import news_data
api_key = "testkey892834789s9s8abshtuy"
paper = news_data.News(api_key)
```

2. A sample test run to get general news. (Returns a JSON Object)

```python
stories = paper.news()
```

3. Since `fin.news()` returns a JSON dict, for a better view of the dict,
you can call the `fin.output()` method on the result. Example:

```python
paper.output(stories)
```

It is important to note that for both the Financial Data Module and the News Data Module, there are many **optional** parameters for the methods. Below is a detailed listing of possible methods for the Financial Data Module and the news Data Module, their method call names, arguments, and what they return.
